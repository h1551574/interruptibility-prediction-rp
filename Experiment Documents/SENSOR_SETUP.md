# Sensor Setup

The Replication Study uses the [NeXus-10 MKII](https://www.mindmedia.com/en/produkte/nexus-10-mkii/) by MindMedia as the Sensor Device. In order to record it uses the [BioTrace+ Software](https://www.mindmedia.com/en/products/biotrace-software/). 

Version **V2018A1** can be downloaded on the support page:

## Channel Set Configuration
To replicate this study the **default** Channel Set configuration can be used with the follwing sensors attached and set to these sampling rates:
- Ground Electrode
- Channel A: EEG (256 Hz)
- Channel B: ECG (256 Hz)
- Channel E: SCR (32 Hz)
- Channel F: Temperature (32 Hz)

## Electrodes
The replication study used "Kendall Medi-Trace 200" electrodes for EEG, ECG and SCR.

**WARNING!:** "Kendall Medi-Trace 200" electrodes **SHOULD NOT** be used for the SCR sensor. Instead use electordes specifically designed for SCR like these [Mindware GSR/GSC Electrodes](https://www.mindwaretech.com/shop/gsr-gsc-electrodes/).
